//	Description = Despite the average Scrapper being fairly unintelligent and not particularly talented in anything other than murder, robbery and crudely modifying stolen tech, some still choose to train themselves and hone their skills in various other disciplines, including marksmanship. The most skilled snipers are given the title of "Deadeye" and awarded an item that makes them easily distinguishable from the rest - a protective headpiece made of a hood from the same fabric used to make vests for other Scrappers and a modified plastic hockey mask, usually painted in team colors with a small margin of error, presumably due to the Scrappers' lack of attention to detail or intelligence. These units aren't much stronger than a basic Junkie, but their marksmanship skills make them more than capable of doing some serious damage to the enemy, especially from afar, and their masks offer additional head protection.
