--- List of common properties, filepaths and functions that need to be changed in order for an outdated mod to be usable in Cortex Command: Community Project.
--- For version: CCCP 0.1.0 pre-release 2
--- Author: Just Alex ;/
--- Contributors: Gacyr, Dood, 4zK


--- Notepad++ or a similar text editing program capable of replacing text across multiple files at once is highly recommended.
--- If you encounter an error even after porting, find the cause of the error! You may have replaced something you weren't supposed to, or the change is too uncommon and hasn't been added to this guide (yet).
--- Note: not nearly all of these changes exist in all mods! Some changes are best found with simple trial-and-error.
