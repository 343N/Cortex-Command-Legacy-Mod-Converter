--- List of common properties, filepaths and functions that need to be changed in order for an outdated mod to be usable in Cortex Command: Community Project.
--- For version: CCCP 0.1.0 pre-release 2
--- Author: Just Alex ;/
--- Contributors: Gacyr, Dood, 4zK


--- Notepad++ or a similar text editing program capable of replacing text across multiple files at once is highly recommended.
--- If you encounter an error even after porting, find the cause of the error! You may have replaced something you weren't supposed to, or the change is too uncommon and hasn't been added to this guide (yet).
--- Note: not nearly all of these changes exist in all mods! Some changes are best found with simple trial-and-error.

---Sounds---
---These two lines appear very frequently, in 99% of all mods! Replace them!---
✓ Sound		to	SoundContainer
✓ AddSample	to	AddSound

✓ Priority	to	// Priority	--Priority for sounds will work differently in the future, so it's best to disable them for now.

---TODO: 'Fuel Fire Trace Black' went from a AEmitter -> PEmitter, so mods assume it's a AEmitter and crash.---
GibParticle = AEmitter\n<tabs-n-times>CopyOf = Fuel Fire Trace Black
---to---
GibParticle = PEmitter\n<tabs-n-times>CopyOf = Fuel Fire Trace Black

---TODO:---
ParticleNumberToAdd = #
AddParticles = MOPixel
	CopyOf = Name
---to---
AddGib = Gib
	GibParticle = MOPixel
		CopyOf = Name
	Count = #
---instead of---
✓ ParticleNumberToAdd	to	// ParticleNumberToAdd
